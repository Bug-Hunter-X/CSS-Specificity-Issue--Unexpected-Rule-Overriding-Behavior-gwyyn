The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.specific-class div {
  color: red; /* This rule is intended to override the first rule */
}

#specific-id div {
  color: green; /* This rule should have the highest specificity and override the previous two */
}

#specific-id.specific-class div {
  color: purple; /*This rule is intended to override previous rules*/
}
```

In this scenario, the rule `#specific-id.specific-class div`  may not override the `#specific-id div` due to the behavior of ID selectors and combined specificity in CSS. Although the final selector combines the highest specificity attributes, the browser may prioritize the selector with just the ID selector. The issue arises because the selectors have different levels of specificity, and the browser will follow specific rules to determine which one takes precedence.

The issue is subtle and depends on the order in which CSS rules are defined, making it a less common error.

The correct approach to override the ID selector is to add an additional style with higher specificity, either by adding more IDs or classes.
