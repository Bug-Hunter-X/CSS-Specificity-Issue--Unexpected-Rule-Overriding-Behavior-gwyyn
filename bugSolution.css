The solution involves understanding and correctly applying CSS specificity rules.  One way to ensure the desired rule takes precedence is to add more classes or IDs to the final selector to make it unequivocally more specific:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.specific-class div {
  color: red;
}

#specific-id div {
  color: green;
}

#specific-id.specific-class.another-class div {
  color: purple; /* More specific selector to ensure override */
}
```

Alternatively, use the `!important` flag (though it's generally discouraged due to potential maintainability issues):

```css
#specific-id div {
  color: green;
}

#specific-id.specific-class div {
  color: purple !important; /*Forces the rule to be applied*/
}
```

By understanding specificity and its possible pitfalls, developers can avoid unexpected rendering and create more predictable stylesheets.
